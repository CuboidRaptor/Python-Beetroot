# Python-Beet
Beet, a general purpose library full of random python functions that I thought were useful. Has file manipulation, random, tts and more!<br>

Run install.bat to install if you're on windows, and on \*nix with Bash installed you can run install.sh.<br>

Else, just open the command prompt on your OS and type `python setup.py install`.
