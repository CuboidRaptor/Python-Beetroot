# Python-Beet
Beet, a general purpose library full of random python functions that I thought were useful. Has file manipulation, random, tts and more!<br>

To install from pip, do `pip install beetroot` to install the bare minimum or use `pip install beetroot[all]`.<br>

To upgrade from pip, do `pip install --upgrade beetroot`

Run install.bat to install from source if you're on windows, and on \*nix with Bash installed you can run install.sh.<br>

Else, just open the command prompt on your OS and type `python setup.py install`.<br>

The source of the module is in [the folder "beetroot"](./beetroot).<br>

Check out [README.rst](./README.rst) for more detailed docs on what you can do with beetroot.<br>

[CHANGELOG.rst](./CHANGELOG.rst) has the changelog for python-beetroot.
